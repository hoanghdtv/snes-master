What is this?

This is a translation patch for Super Bomberman 4 for the Snes.
This is version 1.0 of the patch.

How do I use it?

Use any IPS Patcher and apply this patch to the japanese Super Bomberman 4 rom without a copier header.
If everything works fine the checksum should be ok afterwards.

Story behind the patch

I allways loved Bomberman games - from the first time I played Bomberman on a C64 until nowadays. I was 
totally happy when I found part 4 and 5 on the SNES. Since there is not too much text in Bomberman-games 
I never understood why there was no translation patch for it.
Well ... now I know. It was really challenging (at least for me). The text routine was strange, 
the colour system was terror and the sprite-texts were ... well ... a lot of work ... 
but now it's finally done and every single jap text is translated to english (I hope).

Thanks
I would like to give a big thanks to the friendly guys from ...

... who helped me to translate the japanese texts,
and to Sinap for his great tool SNESEDIT.

If you find any bugs, untranslated textstrings, spelling mistakes, if you want to translate the game 
to any other language and want to save some time, or if you want to tell me how much fun you have with 
the game feel free to contact me :
